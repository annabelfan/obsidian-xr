Proper handling of [[occlusion]] in AR allows for improved user experience (Azuma et al., 1999).

When [[occlusion]] is improperly handled in AR contexts, this leads to incorrect spatial judgments in the observer which can impact hand-eye coordination, increase eyestrain and the probability of motion sickness (Fuhrmann et al., 1999).  

[[@macedo_occlusion_2023]] reviews 161 articles between 1992 and 2020 focusing on the occlusion handling problem in AR applications. 

[[@au_misperception_2024]] observed that viewers depth perception was biased towards the occluder, even when reach-based proprioceptive information was available. 

Li et al., (2021) reported that incorrect occlusion (far block visible over top of pointing hand) reduced accuracy, increased completion time, and reduced subjective levels of confidence in a pointing task.
