Proper handling of [[occlusion]] in AR allows for improved user experience (Azuma et al., 1999).

When [[occlusion]] is improperly handled in AR contexts, this leads to incorrect spatial judgments in the observer which can impact hand-eye coordination, increase eyestrain and the probability of motion sickness (Fuhrmann et al., 1999).  


[[@macedo_occlusion_2023]] reviews 161 articles between 1992 and 2020 focusing on the occlusion handling problem in AR applications.
