[[@swan_perceptual_2006]], had 9 observers judge the distance of an augmented reality rectangle at various distances (medium and far-field; Cutting, 2003), field of view (upper vs. lower). and with or without a physical occluder in a perceptual matching task. Their main findings were that observers underestimated the distance of the rendered target at near distances (<23m) and overestimated the distance of the target at far distances (>23m), with their bias crossing directions around 23m. 

This bias shift was also reported by Foley, 1993 who isolated binocular disparity and found this veridical judgement zone to be 1-4m.

The authors also found an occluder and distance interaction, where the the presence of an occluder increased the absolute judgment error.

Linear modeling of [[@swan_perceptual_2006]]'s data results in the quantification of error due to the occuder's presence as follows:
$$y_{present} - y_{absent} = .08x-.33$$
