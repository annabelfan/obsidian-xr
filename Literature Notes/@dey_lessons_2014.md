Reviews different visualization methods for x-ray vision in AR, such as: edge-overlay -ray, saliency-based x-ray, and melt vision for handheld AR systems. The authors suggest the following:
- Implementing AR systems with dynamically changing GFOV
- More research is needed on the effect of display technologies used in AR on depth judgment, e.g., handheld displays with lower resolution or FoV 
- Investigate the effect of motion parallax in handheld AR, as participants did not move their displays although they were freely able to, perhaps adding motion parallax will prompt users to make use of this additional depth information 
- Finally, increasing the diversity in these user groups as most studies have been done on male participants between 20-40 years.
