X-ray vision is a common metaphor for the capability of [[augmented-reality]] to allow users to "see through" physical opaque surfaces ([[@livongston_pursuit_2013]]; [[@dey_lessons_2014]]). 

- [[@livongston_pursuit_2013]] Livingston et al., 2013, believe the x-ray metaphor was first applied to  Stix, 1992. 


Because this is not a natural capability of human vision, metaphors such as [[x-Ray vision]] are important (and of which we have few) to convey this functionality ([[@livongston_pursuit_2013]])


[[@livongston_pursuit_2013]], provide a thorough review of x-ray vision in augmented reality including: experimental paradigms, different methods of simulating x-ray vision, and results from past studies.

[[@macedo_occlusion_2023]], label this as an optional occlusion handling problem as compared to the order problem to render real and virtual objects in the correct depth order.
