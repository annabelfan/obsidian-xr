# Defining the Question


- Link performance data with comfort data (TH1)
- Evaluate mid/long-term impact of VAC on visual performance/comfort-fatigue
- How much the short term (psychophysical) impacts can predict the long-term (fatigue/comfort) impacts 

Research Question: What is the association between short and long-term effects of VAC on visual performance and fatigue? 
- Individual Differences 
- Quantitative vs. Qualitative measures 

Literature Review Question: What are the appropriate measures of visual performance and fatigue if we want to predict long term impact of VAC based on short term impacts of VAC

Literature Review Goal: Define the scope, key outcomes, procedures, and analyses for THX

# Topics to Cover
- What is [[vergence accommodation conflict]] (VAC)? 
	- VAC, AR, VR
- Define [[visual fatigue]] (VF)
	- Visual fatigue, visual comfort, simulator sickness, visual fatigue in UX, quantitative/objective measurements of VF, VF eye tracking, VF biometrics
	- How is Visual Fatigue measured qualitatively/quantitatively? (Visual comfort vs fatigue?)
- Define [[visual performance]] (VP)
	- Time to fuse, Metrics of visual performance, visual performance in UX, quantitative/objective measurements of VP, eye tracking VP
	- How is Visual Performance measured qualitatively/quantitatively?

- How does VAC impact visual performance?
- How does VAC impact visual comfort/fatigue?
- What is known about the time course of VAC's effects on VP and VF?

- What mixed methods analysis approaches are there?
- What predictive modelling approaches are there?

*Thompson House Extended*

- What time course or short vs long term effects methods are there?
- What is an appropriate/expected short vs. long term time scale?

## Exploratory Topics To Consider
